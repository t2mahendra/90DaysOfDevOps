# Kubernetes Architecture and Cluster Setup

## Task Done
You have been building and shipping containers with Docker. But what happens when you need to run hundreds of containers across multiple servers? You need an orchestrator. Today you start your Kubernetes journey — understand the architecture, set up a local cluster, and run your first `kubectl` commands.

### Task 1: Recall the Kubernetes Story
Before touching a terminal, write down from memory:

1. Why was Kubernetes created? What problem does it solve that Docker alone cannot?

   Kubernetes was created (originally by Google) to manage containers at scale in production environments. Before Kubernetes, tools like Docker made it easy to create and run containers—but only on a single machine or in a very limited way across machines.
   
2. Who created Kubernetes and what was it inspired by?

   Kubernetes was originally created by Borg engineers at Google and released as an open-source project in 2014.
   
3. What does the name "Kubernetes" mean?

   K8s
That’s because:
There are 8 letters between K and s in “Kubernetes”
(K + 8 letters + s)

---

### Task 2: Draw the Kubernetes Architecture
From memory, draw or describe the Kubernetes architecture. Your diagram should include:

![Kubernetes Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9028bf7a-07ba-44fa-8da9-5697a97b36fa)


**Control Plane (Master Node):**
- API Server — the front door to the cluster, every command goes through it
- etcd — the database that stores all cluster state
- Scheduler — decides which node a new pod should run on
- Controller Manager — watches the cluster and makes sure the desired state matches reality

**Worker Node:**
- kubelet — the agent on each node that talks to the API server and manages pods
- kube-proxy — handles networking rules so pods can communicate
- Container Runtime — the engine that actually runs containers (containerd, CRI-O)


### Task 3: Install kubectl
`kubectl` is the CLI tool you will use to talk to your Kubernetes cluster.

Install it:
```bash
# macOS
brew install kubectl

# Linux (amd64)
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
chmod +x kubectl
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

# Windows (with chocolatey)
choco install kubernetes-cli
```

Verify:
```bash
kubectl version --client
```

---

### Task 4: Set Up Your Local Cluster
Choose **one** of the following. Both give you a fully functional Kubernetes cluster on your machine.

**Option A: kind (Kubernetes in Docker)**
```bash
# Install kind
# macOS
brew install kind

# Linux
curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/latest/kind-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./kind
sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind
<img width="711" height="135" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0cb26e1-3a5a-4553-9c72-1cd4c4ef6f6b" />


# Create a cluster
kind create cluster --name devops-cluster
<img width="491" height="231" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/757bb16e-b698-4b0c-bf4b-2c1124b90d5d" />


# Verify
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes

<img width="855" height="94" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68ffa87f-0bfc-41c5-a8c5-729249cbc909" />

```

**Option B: minikube**
```bash
# Install minikube
# macOS
brew install minikube

# Linux
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

# Start a cluster
minikube start

# Verify
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes
```

Write down: Which one did you choose and why?

---

### Task 5: Explore Your Cluster
Now that your cluster is running, explore it:

```bash
# See cluster info
kubectl cluster-info

# List all nodes
kubectl get nodes

# Get detailed info about your node
kubectl describe node <node-name>

# List all namespaces
kubectl get namespaces

# See ALL pods running in the cluster (across all namespaces)
kubectl get pods -A
```

Look at the pods running in the `kube-system` namespace:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

You should see pods like `etcd`, `kube-apiserver`, `kube-scheduler`, `kube-controller-manager`, `coredns`, and `kube-proxy`. These are the architecture components you drew in Task 2 — running as pods inside the cluster.

**Verify:** Can you match each running pod in `kube-system` to a component in your architecture diagram?

---

### Task 6: Practice Cluster Lifecycle
Build muscle memory with cluster operations:

```bash
# Delete your cluster
kind delete cluster --name devops-cluster
# (or: minikube delete)

# Recreate it
kind create cluster --name devops-cluster
# (or: minikube start)

# Verify it is back
kubectl get nodes
```

Try these useful commands:
```bash
# Check which cluster kubectl is connected to
kubectl config current-context

# List all available contexts (clusters)
kubectl config get-contexts

# See the full kubeconfig
kubectl config view
```

Write down: What is a kubeconfig? Where is it stored on your machine?

---

## Hints
- kind requires Docker to be running (it creates clusters using containers)
- minikube can use Docker, VirtualBox, or other drivers
- The default kubeconfig file is at `~/.kube/config`
- `kubectl get pods -A` is short for `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`
- If `kubectl` cannot connect, check if your cluster is running: `kind get clusters` or `minikube status`
- `-o wide` flag gives extra details: `kubectl get nodes -o wide`

---

## Documentation
Create `day-50-k8s-setup.md` with:
- Kubernetes history in your own words (3-4 sentences)
- Your architecture diagram (text-based or image)
- Which tool you chose (kind/minikube) and why
- Screenshot of `kubectl get nodes` and `kubectl get pods -n kube-system`
- What each kube-system pod does

---

## Submission
1. Add `day-50-k8s-setup.md` to `2026/day-50/`
2. Commit and push to your fork

## Learn in Public
Share on LinkedIn: "Started my Kubernetes journey today. Set up a local cluster, explored the architecture, and saw the control plane components running as actual pods. The orchestration chapter begins."
